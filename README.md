# Gold-Price-Prediction-using-ML

In this Project, We have emphasised on  how to analyze and predict, the upcoming prices of Gold, using Machine Learning Algorithm named Random Forest regressor.

Workflow of the Project:-
  1) Data Preprocessing
  2) Data Analysis
  3) Splitting the Dataset
  4) Applying ML algorithm
  5) Model Evaluation
